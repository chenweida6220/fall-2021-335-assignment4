i.) All parts of Assignment 4 have been completed and compiles successfully.
ii.) The majority of the bugs I encountered were runtime errors from not accessing
the right elements and objects.
iii.)
To compile on terminal type
  make clean
  make all
  ./test_sorting_algorithms <input_type> <input_size> <comparison_type>

  Ex:
  ./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less
  ./test_sorting_algorithms sorted_small_to_large 10000 greater
  ./test_sorting_algorithms random 20000 less
